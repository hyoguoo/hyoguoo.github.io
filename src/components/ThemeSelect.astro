/**
 * ThemeSelect — Starlight component override (intentional passthrough)
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
 * starlight-blog registers its own ThemeSelect override that appends a "Blog"
 * link inside the theme-select area of the nav bar.  Starlight resolves
 * component overrides in registration order, so the last plugin to register
 * wins.  By declaring our own ThemeSelect override in astro.config.mjs
 * (under `components:`), we take precedence over starlight-blog's version and
 * prevent the unwanted "Blog" link from being injected.
 *
 * This component deliberately does nothing extra — it just delegates to the
 * default Starlight ThemeSelect.  DO NOT remove it from astro.config.mjs or
 * the starlight-blog override will take over again.
