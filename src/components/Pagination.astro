/**
 * Pagination — Starlight component override (intentionally empty)
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS BLANK:
 * Starlight renders previous/next article navigation links at the bottom of
 * every docs page via its built-in Pagination component.  We do not want that
 * UI on this site (docs pages have no meaningful prev/next ordering).
 *
 * By registering this empty override in astro.config.mjs (`components:
 * { Pagination: '...' }`) we suppress the default output entirely without
 * touching Starlight internals.
 *
 * Note: blog post prev/next navigation is provided separately by the
 * starlight-blog plugin's own PrevNextLinks component, which is hidden via
 * `.post-footer .pagination { display: none; }` in custom.css because that
 * plugin uses the Starlight Pagination slot in a different way.
 *
 * DO NOT add content here — the blank render is the intended behaviour.
